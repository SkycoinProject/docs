**cx** has a very intuitive syntax and very similar to that of the
[go programming language](https://golang.org/), which allows beginners to get into
the software world to start, develop their first programs and get in touch of the
world of computer science and it allows expert software developers can migrate to
language, learn very quickly their syntax and special features, and start
developing all kinds of systems, libraries, tools, frameworks, among other things.

This is a new language, it was created on July 15, 2017, by
[Skycoin](https://www.skycoin.com/) which means that it will have long-term
support, besides that it has a large community behind that each day is growing more
and more, and that will cause it to develop over time. Apart from being a general
purpose language, the main objective of **cx** is to be able to integrate with
technologies and tools created by [Skycoin](https://www.skycoin.com/). Being a
compiled and interpreted language, it offers the benefits of both and provides a
large field of software development.
