+++

**CX** being a high-level programming language compiled and interpreted, it can be
used in a wide variety of branches of computer science, such as can be used to
create programs that optimize processes or even create systems highly complex.
Thanks to its easy and intuitive syntax, very similar to the go or python
programming language, the learning curve is very short and allows developers and
software engineers to focus on solving the main problem, without having to worry
about the syntax.

The great speed offered by a **CX** program allows the development of complex
systems such as:

* Databases, relational and non-relational
* HTTP, FTP, SSH, SMTP, DNS servers and more.
* [Multi-platform games](https://github.com/SkycoinProject/cx-games)
* Web, desktop and mobile frameworks
* Command line software
* Transpilators, compilers and interpreted languages
* Security tools
* Blockchains
* Emulators
* Cryptocurrencies
* Libraries
* E-commerce
* much more

But what makes **CX** stand out among hundreds and thousands of programming
languages ​​created over time, is not its syntax or its great speed, are actually its
main features, which are:

* The Affordances, which represent a finite set of actions that can be performed on
  an element of the program, for example, the programmer can describe the
  environment where the module is compiled and run and the module will change its
  behavior according to those actions.
* The serialization, which can be done even when the program is running in its
  interpreted or compiled form. A **CX** program can fully or partially serialize
  itself and send that serialized content over the internet into a remote computer
  and then resume its execution.
* Program stepping, which allows the software developer to control the execution of
  the program in a desired number of steps.
